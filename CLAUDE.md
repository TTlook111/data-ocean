This file gives AI coding agents project-specific guidance for working in this repository.

## Project Overview

DataOcean is an enterprise NL2SQL intelligent data query and governance platform. It lets business users ask questions in natural language, generates safe SQL, executes read-only queries, and returns table/chart results. The core design is metadata-governance-driven trustworthy querying.

MVP scope: multi-data-source management, with each query selecting one MySQL data source and supporting multi-table joins inside that database.

## Architecture

```text
Vue 3 frontend
  - query app and admin governance app
  - Axios, Element Plus, ECharts, GSAP
        |
        | HTTP API
        v
Spring Boot Java gateway
  - auth, permissions, datasource management
  - metadata governance, skills.md lifecycle
  - audit, masking, task state, versioning
        |
        | internal HTTP (RestClient)
        v
Python FastAPI AI service
  - query rewrite, Schema RAG, SQL generation
  - SQL AST validation and sandbox execution
  - chart generation, chunking, embedding, reranking
        |
        v
Milvus / MySQL / Redis / Qwen
```

Important boundary:

- Java owns management lifecycle: document drafts, review, versioning, publishing, task state, permissions, audit, and Java-side persistence.
- Python owns AI/RAG execution: chunking, embedding, Milvus writes, retrieval, reranking, SQL generation, SQL validation, and sandbox execution.
- Frontend calls Java only. Java calls Python through internal APIs.
- Java→Python calls use `RestClient` with `@Retryable` on knowledge/RAG client methods (2 attempts, 1s backoff). SSE streaming and health checks do not retry.

## Current Status

Last updated: 2026-06-08.

The main end-to-end chain is implemented:

```text
Java query task -> Python Agent -> RAG retrieval -> SQL generation
-> sqlglot AST validation/rewrite -> sandbox execution -> Java persistence -> frontend rendering
```

## RAG And skills.md Lifecycle

The current RAG implementation intentionally uses Python for chunking and vector operations.

Responsibilities:

- Java:
  - manages skills.md lifecycle: `DRAFT -> PENDING_REVIEW -> APPROVED -> INDEXING -> PUBLISHED`;
  - manages review, versioning, publish task state, rollback state, and audit;
  - stores the chunk snapshot returned by Python in MySQL table `knowledge_chunk`;
  - marks the new version active only after Milvus write and verification succeed;
  - keeps the old active version available when new vectorization fails.
- Python:
  - chunks skills.md through `/internal/rag/chunk`;
  - embeds chunks;
  - writes vectors to Milvus;
  - verifies vector count;
  - serves retrieval and reranking.

Publishing flow:

```text
APPROVED document
  -> Java marks INDEXING and creates vector task
  -> Python chunks skills.md
  -> Java stores returned chunk snapshot in MySQL
  -> Python embeds and writes Milvus vectors
  -> Python verifies Milvus vector count
  -> Java transaction marks chunks INDEXED, document PUBLISHED, task COMPLETED
  -> Python cleans previous version vectors
```

Failure rule:

- If chunking or vectorization fails, Java restores the document to `APPROVED`.
- Old active vectors are not deleted before the new version is successfully verified.
- Same-version rebuilds delete only `doc_id + version_no`, not all vectors for the document.

Recent RAG lifecycle change:

- Java-side `KnowledgeChunkSplitter` was removed.
- Python `chunker.py` is the source of truth for chunking.
- Python chunking splits by `##` sections and then by `###` subsections for fine-grained chunks.
- Flyway migration `V35__rag_python_chunking_lifecycle.sql` updates chunk lifecycle metadata and adds `idx_chunk_doc_version`.

## Core Domain Concepts

- `skills.md`: business semantic knowledge generated from metadata governance results, reviewed by humans, then published into RAG.
- Field confidence: 0-100 score influencing SQL field selection.
- RAG admission control: only approved and allowed governance states can enter retrieval.
- Sensitive fields: may enter RAG with mask metadata, but Java gateway performs final masking.
- Deprecated/blocked fields: must not be retrieved or used in SQL generation.
- Query Rewrite: resolves time expressions, references, and user intent before retrieval and SQL generation.

## Frontend Notes

Frontend routes are split between:

- `/query`: user-facing intelligent query flow.
- `/admin/*`: governance, metadata, knowledge, prompt, audit, permissions, and system management.

## Working Rules

- Prefer existing project patterns over introducing new abstractions.
- Keep Java responsible for governance and lifecycle state.
- Keep Python responsible for AI execution, chunking, embedding, Milvus, retrieval, reranking, and SQL sandbox behavior.
- Never delete active RAG vectors until the replacement version is written and verified.
- Use focused tests when changing lifecycle, RAG, SQL safety, permissions, or public API behavior.
- Preserve user changes in the working tree; do not reset or revert unrelated files.
